Qu Kai: What are the similarities and differences between mobile internet Infra and AI Infra?

Yibo: Their underlying goals are the same: to efficiently and reliably integrate **compute**, **communication**, and **storage** resources. But in practice, their requirements for hardware, network interconnects, and storage are completely different. For example, the absolute core of AI Infra is the GPU, whereas the core of traditional Infra is the CPU. In the world of Infra, there isn’t much new under the sun, but AI Infra has to go further in many areas and be more closely tailored to AI’s specific needs.
