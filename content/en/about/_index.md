Hi üëã I‚Äôm **Yufan**.

### Who I am  

Software engineer specializing in cloud computing and computer networking, based in Seattle.

### Current work & core skills

### Values & working principles  

**Efficiency-driven.**  
If a task bores me twice, I automate it.

**Coding should be fun.**  
Enjoy the creative spark coding brings, rather than seeing it only as a livelihood.

**Stay focused.**  
Relish the sense of fulfillment that sustained focus adds to life.

### Why this blog exists  

To share efficiency hacks, showcase side-projects and workflows, document lessons from technical challenges, and connect with fellow engineers who love the same nerdy stuff.
